# FlaxSpaceFighterDemo
A space fighter demo for Flax Engine.

For now you can modify key bindings in Content/Settings/Input Settings.

Inputs :
- Shift : Accelerate
- Z & S : Pitch
- Q & D : Roll

You can center the mouse on the screen to stop mouse movement.

The main purpose of this demo is to show some gameplay/movement mechanics and not awesome graphics due to my limited resources.
